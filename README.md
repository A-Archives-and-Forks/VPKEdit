  <h1>VPKTool</h1>
</div>

Code was based off of https://github.com/SteamDatabase/ValvePak and the Valve Developer Wiki.
The libvpktool library allows the user to read and write files in a VPK, as well as create new VPKs.

A GUI is also included to preview files in a VPK, extract them to disk, add and remove files, and create new VPKs.
It has all the capabilities of GCFScape and much more:
